What’s the deal? Why did I wait a week for this update? Well, here’s why.

Changes

Added new First Person Mode (aiming with gun scope coming soon)
New map, “Inlands”. Gear up and drop into the desert lands.
New map, “The Stadium”. Natural cover? No. Only you, and other boxes. And guns, too.
CUSTOM MENU BACKGROUNDS! (info on how to make these work below)
Spacialized gun sounds (made you only hear them if your within range of the bullet/player)
Added a lil’ feature… click keys on your keyboard then look at your character… then you’ll find out 😉 

Bugfixes

Fixed Camera FOV only be able to be set to 15 maximum in main menu but 120 max in game
Fixed bug where loading screen would cover whole screen on resolutions other than 1920x1080
Fixed various glitches in ‘Canadia’.
Fixed glitch where you could not exit the Fence Account menu unless you logged in or quit your game.
