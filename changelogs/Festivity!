Welcome to the first Christmas of Boxfight! This update needed to be special to us so we made it special. It's full of new stuff! So let's get into it.
Changes
• Added new map - Winter Skirmish.
• Added new interactable items! Buttons and Waffles. Heck yeah!
• Buttons let you interact with specific items. See if you can find one in the new map...
• Waffles give you a random amount of health, from 10-25hp. These don't regenerate at the moment.
• Added snow to the main menu!
• Allowed you to set a specific path for your custom stuff - so it doesn't wipe every update.
• Added the ability to customise your menu snow!
• Added weapon sway.
• Added Anti-Cheat (well... sort of...).
• Boxfight is being developed by Theory of Developers now! This is me and another few (2) people who also work on the project.

Bugfixes
• Nothing that we can remember of. That probably means all the bugs you experienced before probably got fixed but we can't remember.
