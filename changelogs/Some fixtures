Welcome back to Boxfight! Today we made some more changes to Boxfight and how it plays out. We also added some new stuff! Here it is.

- added new bullet impacts, they come with cool new animations that look cute too :D
- let you shoot in the air, i got bullied into doing this lmfao
- made gun sounds get networked over all clients in the room
- you HAVE to have an account to play Boxfight now. Sorry!
- fixed bug where you couldn't quit the Aim Trainer or Flyover Mode.
- Removed guns from Flyover Mode.

Anywho, that's all for this devlog. See you guys later!
